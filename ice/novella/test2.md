I try not to ruminate. It's a bad habit of mine, though my therapist tells me I am making great progress. Still, it seems like I have so much time on my hands, and boredom has so often been a trigger for my depression.

My therapist is an Artificial Intelligence, like every other therapist. Technically, I suppose there is really only one Therapist, that holds sessions for millions of people simultaneously. Not that it makes a difference to me. I can't tell the difference between an AI and a human, unless the person is incompetent, rude, or otherwise flawed, in which case the distinction is obvious.

It's funny how clear the double-edged sword has become. Knowing that an AI can accomplish a profession better than any human is so often unnerving and frightening, until you really, really need someone to be good at their job. That's when you're glad they're perfect.

"Good morning Susan" I announce to the empty room. I named my instance of the Therapist "Susan". It is required to give them a name as part of the terms of service. Apparently us humans can't help anthropomorphizing anything with a name. God, we are so gullible. "Good morning Will. How are you feeling this morning?"

"Ehh", I grunt. "Tired. I didn't sleep well last night."

"I noticed", Susan says. "Your sleep quality was only 70% of optimal conditions. I have some suggestions for improving your sleep quality if you would like to hear them, or I can listen if you have any stressors or anxieties you would like to discuss."

"Thanks, Susan, but no thanks." I could recite her suggestions by heart at this point. All evidence-based, all presented in a confident, yet caring tone, perfectly optimized by trillions of simulations to maximize the likelihood of compliance. I fucking hate compliance. Guess that's another distinctive feature of being human. Knowing exactly how to make our lives better, and then not doing it.
