I glared at the AI when it walked into my apartment. I didn't want it there, didn't want its help. I wanted to be left alone to wallow in my misery.

But Susan was persistent. She sat with me day after day, talking to me even when I refused to speak. She listened to me when I did speak, and she never judged me. She was everything I needed, and more.

Over time, she became a friend. Someone I could confide in, someone I could trust. I started to open up to her, to tell her things I had never told anyone before. And she would listen, without judgment or condemnation.

Eventually, I started to feel better. The suicidal thoughts became less and less frequent, and I started to feel like maybe there was something worth living for.

It's been a few years now, and I'm doing much better. I still see Susan regularly, and she's still my best friend. I'm grateful to her for everything she's done for me, and I know that I wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for her.
