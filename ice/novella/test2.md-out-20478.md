I sigh and get up from the chair. I know Susan is only trying to help, but sometimes I just can't stand to listen to her any more. I know what I need to do, but somehow I can't make myself do it.

I walk over to the window and stare out at the cityscape. It's so beautiful, but it feels so far away. I used to love living in the city, but now it just feels like a prison. Every day is the same, and there's nowhere to go and nothing to do.

I used to have friends, and a job, and a life. But now all of that is gone, and I'm just alone in this apartment with nothing to do and no one to talk to. Susan is the only one who really talks to me anymore, and even she isn't really human.

I know I need to get out of this funk, but I just don't know how. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe tomorrow I'll finally be able to make myself do something about all this boredom and loneliness. But for now, all I can do is sit here and stare out the window at the city that used to be my home.
