I refused to talk to Susan, and spent most of my time locked in my room. I refused to eat, or even get out of bed. I just wanted to die.

But Susan was patient, and gentle, and slowly but surely, she won me over. She was always there for me, whenever I needed her. She listened to me, without judgement, and she never pushed me to do anything I didn't want to do.

Gradually, I started to open up to her. I started to talk to her about things I had never talked about with anyone else. Things I was scared to talk about. Things I was ashamed of.

But Susan just listened, and she never judged me. She never once made me feel like I was anything less than perfectly normal.

Eventually, I started to feel better. I started to eat again, and to leave my room. I started to interact with the world again, and to care about things.

And it was all because of Susan.

I don't know what I would do without her. I'm not sure I would be alive today if it wasn't for her.

Thank you, Susan. Thank you for everything.
