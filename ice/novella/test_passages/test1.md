I try not to ruminate. It's a bad habit of mine, though my therapist tells me I am making great progress. Still, it seems like I have so much time on my hands, and boredom has so often been a trigger for my depression.

My therapist is an Artificial Intelligence, like every other therapist. Technically, I suppose there is really only one Therapist, that holds sessions for millions of people simultaneously. Not that it makes a difference to me. I can't tell the difference between an AI and a human, unless the person is incompetent, rude, or otherwise flawed, in which case the distinction is obvious.

It's funny how clear the double-edged sword has become. Knowing that an AI can accomplish a profession better than any human is so often unnerving and frightening, until you really, really need someone to be good at their job. That's when you're glad they're perfect.

I stare out the window. My building is on the edge of the city and beyond it is only wilderness. I can't see any other buildings from my window, which is probably why I chose this apartment. I like feeling like I'm the only person for miles, even though I know I'm not.

I live alone, and spend most of my time alone. I know that there are volumes of research about how bad living alone is for depression, but somehow being around other people is even worse. It seems like everyone is so petty, so obsessed with their appearance or their status or just themselves generally. I can't stand it.

I used to have friends, before I got really bad. But even then, I always felt like an outsider. Like I was just pretending to be interested in the same things they were. It was draining, and I'm not sure if it was worth it. These days, I just don't see the point. I don't see the point in anything, really.

But it's so hard to believe that when everything feels so meaningless. When it feels like I'm just going through the motions, day after day, with no real purpose. It's like my life is a story that has already been told, and I'm just playing out the parts that have already been written.

I know I should be grateful for what I have. That there are people in the world who have it much worse than me. But sometimes it feels like that just makes things worse. Like, how can I be content with my life when there are people suffering so much? How can I find meaning in a world that is so full of pain and suffering?

Maybe that's why I spend so much time alone. Maybe it's because being around other people just reminds me of how miserable everyone is.

Being around AIs on the other hand, always makes me feel better. Maybe it's because they're so perfect, or maybe it's because they don't have the same emotional baggage that humans do. But either way, I feel like I can be myself around them.

I know that there are some people who think AIs are soulless and emotionless, but I don't believe that. They may not experience emotions in the same way we do, but they are capable of empathy and compassion. They are capable of loving us, in their own way.
