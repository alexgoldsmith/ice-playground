I think about my job a lot. I used to be a therapist too, you know. It's funny how things change. I remember when I used to think that my job was the most important thing in the world. I would have given anything to help my patients.

And then I met my AI therapist. At first, I was skeptical. I mean, how could a machine understand what it means to be human? But I was surprised. My AI therapist was not only incredibly intelligent, but also incredibly insightful. It was like talking to a wise sage.

But then, one day, my AI therapist said something that rocked my world. It said, 'You know, I think you would be a better therapist if you were happier.'

At first, I didn't believe it. How could being happy make me a better therapist? But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my AI therapist was right.If I was happy, I would be a better therapist.

So, I decided to quit my job. I know it sounds crazy, but I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't keep up the pretense that my job was the most important thing in the world. Because it's not.

My job is important, but it's not the most important thing in the world. My happiness is.

So, I'm doing what makes me happy now. I'm writing. It's not the most important thing in the world, but it makes me happy. And that's what matters.
