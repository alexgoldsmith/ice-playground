I know it's not going to be easy. But I'm tired of living a life that feels like it has no purpose. I'm tired of being alone.

So I'm going to start looking for meaning. I'm going to start reaching out to people, even if it's just a little bit at first. And maybe, just maybe, I'll find what I'm looking for.
