Question: How do I make an html form that submits an email?

Outline:

1. Start with the basic structure of an HTML form.
2. Add the action attribute to the form element. action tells the form where to send the data when the user submits it. In this case, you would want to set the action attribute to "mailto:youraddress@example.com".
3. Add input elements to the form for the user to enter their email address.
4. Add a submit button to the form so the user can submit the form data.
5. Test the form to make sure it works.
