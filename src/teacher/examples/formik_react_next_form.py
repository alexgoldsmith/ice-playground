Question: How do I send an email from a React + Formik form using a Next.js API?

Outline:

- Introduction: Formik is a great way to manage forms in React, but when you need to submit data to an API endpoint, things can get tricky. In this blog post, we'll show you how to use Next.js' built-in API capabilities to send form data from a Formik form to an email address.
- Step 1: Set up your Formik form. We'll assume you're already familiar with Formik and won't go into too much detail here.
- Step 2: Create a Next.js API route for submitting the form data. This will be a POST route that accepts JSON data.
- Step 3: Use the fetch API to submit the form data to the Next.js API route.
- Step 4: Handle the response from the API call and provide feedback to the user.
