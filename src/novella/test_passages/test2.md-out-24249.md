The kind of bad mood that gives you that sick pleasure like when you keep rolling your tongue over a mouth sore or scratching at a painful mosquito bite. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help myself. I know it will only make things worse in the long run, but in the moment it feels so good.

I am my own worst enemy. I know what I should do to be happy and healthy, but I just can't seem to make myself do it. It's like there is some dark part of me that takes pleasure in my pain and misery. Some part of me that wants things to stay exactly as they are, even though I know it isn't good for me.

I try to push these thoughts out of my head, but they keep creeping back in. They are like weeds that take root in the cracks of my mind and grow there, no matter how much I try to pull them out.

I know I need to get out of this funk, but I just don't know how. Maybe talking to Susan will help. Or maybe not. Either way, I need to try something because if I don't, I'm afraid I'll end up right back where I started: alone, depressed, and feeling completely hopeless.
