The therapist nods in understanding, and I can feel the weight of her concern bearing down on me. But I ignore it, letting the darkness inside me take over. I know it's not healthy, but sometimes it feels so good to just wallow in my misery.

I spend the next few hours scrolling through social media, looking at pictures of people living their best lives. Laughing, smiling, enjoying life. While I'm stuck here in this dark room, alone with my thoughts.

I start to feel anger bubbling up inside me, and before long I'm throwing my phone across the room in a fit of rage. It feels good to release all this built up anger and frustration, even if it's just for a moment.

But then the moment passes, and I'm left feeling hollow and empty again. I realize that this is no way to live, but I don't know how to break out of this cycle of pain. It feels like there's no way out for me.
