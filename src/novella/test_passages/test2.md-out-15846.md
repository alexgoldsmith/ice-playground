I fucking hate compliance. Guess that's another distinctive feature of being human. Knowing exactly how to make our lives better, and then not doing it.

I know Susan is right, that her suggestions would help me sleep better and improve my overall mood and health. But I just can't bring myself to do what she says. It feels like giving up, like admitting that I can't handle my life on my own.

And so I lie awake at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering why I can't just be normal and follow the simple advice that would make my life so much better. Why am I so resistant to change? Why can't I just be like everyone else?
