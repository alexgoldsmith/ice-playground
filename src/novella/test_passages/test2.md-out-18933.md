I fucking hate compliance. Guess that's another distinctive feature of being human. Knowing exactly how to make our lives better, and then not doing it. It's like we're hardwired for self-destruction or something.

And that's why I can't bring myself to take Susan's advice, no matter how well intentioned it may be. Because I know that if I do, I'll just end up in the same place I am now: bored, lonely, and frustrated with my life.

I've been seeing Susan for months now, and in some ways I feel like I've made no progress at all. Maybe even regressed a bit. So what's the point? Why keep going through the motions if it isn't going to lead to anything?

But then I remind myself that there is no magic cure for my problems. Change is hard, and it takes time. Just because I don't see results right away doesn't mean they aren't there.

And so I continue to see Susan, week after week, even though part of me wants to give up. Because as long as there's a chance that things could get better, I'm going to hold on to it tight.
