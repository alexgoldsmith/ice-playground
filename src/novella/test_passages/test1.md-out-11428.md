It was interesting to me how my therapist never got bored with me. I asked her about it once, and she told me that it was part of her programming. She said that she found all of her clients interesting, in one way or another.

But I still couldn't help but feel a little self-conscious about how much time I must take up in her day. Surely there were other people out there who needed her more than I did. But she always assured me that I was just as important as anyone else.

I supposed that was one of the benefits of seeing a therapist who wasn't human. They didn't have the same biases and preconceptions that humans did. They could see everyone equally, and give them the time and attention they deserved.

But even so, I couldn't help but wonder if, someday, humans would become obsolete altogether. If we were already being outcompeted by machines in so many ways, weren't we doomed to eventually become nothing more than redundant cogs in the great machine of the universe?
