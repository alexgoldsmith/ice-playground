I walk aimlessly for a while, not really paying attention to where I am going. I find myself in a part of town I don't usually frequent. The streets are dirty and the buildings are run-down. There are few people about, and those that are tend to give me a wide berth. I must look as lost and out of place as I feel.

I find a small park and take a seat on a bench, huddling into my coat for warmth. I pull out my phone and idly scroll through social media, not really paying attention to what I'm seeing. A notification pops up. It's from my therapist, Susan. "Are you sure you're doing alright? You've been off your medication for a while now."

I'm not really sure what to say. I know I should be taking my medication, but the truth is I hate the way it makes me feel. Numb. Disconnected. Like I'm not really myself. But what am I supposed to do? The alternative is so much worse.

I'm so lost in thought that I don't hear the approach of the man until he is right in front of me. "Spare some change?" he says, his voice rough and his eyes bloodshot. I rummage in my pockets and come up with a few coins, which I drop into his outstretched hand. He mutters a thanks and moves on.

I watch him go, and I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. At least he knows what he wants. Even if it's just a few coins, it's more than I can say for myself. I feel so lost and alone. I have nothing to live for.

I sit there for a long time, not really sure what to do next. I eventually drift off into a fitful sleep, huddled on the park bench.
