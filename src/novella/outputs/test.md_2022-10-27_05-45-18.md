I step out into the bitter cold, relishing the numbing sensation. I walk aimlessly, my feet taking me where they will. I am not thinking about where I am going, or what I will do when I get there. I am simply enjoying the sensation of being alive.

I am interrupted by the high-pitched whine of a delivery drone overhead. The noise grows louder and more shrill until my ears are ringing and I feel a pain in my skull. I curse the drone and its operator, whoever they may be.

I stumble onwards, my head throbbing. I am beginning to regret coming out here. I should have just stayed in my apartment and talked to Susan. But it is too late to turn back now.

I round a corner and come face to face with a group of teenagers. They are laughing and joking, oblivious to the cold and my pain. I can't help but feel a moment of envy. They have their entire lives ahead of them, while I am just trudging through mine.

I try to push past them, but they block my way. "Hey old man, where are you going in such a hurry?" one of them jeers.

I don't answer, I just try to push past them again. But they continue to block my way and laugh at me. I feel my anger rising. I know I should just walk away, but I can't. I can't let them laugh at me.

I lash out, hitting one of the teenagers with all my force. He falls to the ground, blood streaming from his nose. The others back away, fear in their eyes.

I stand over the teenager, my chest heaving. I can't believe I just did that. I've never hit anyone in my life. But I don't regret it. I feel alive for the first time in months.

The teenager gets to his feet, wiping the blood from his face. "You're going to regret that," he says, before turning and fleeing with his friends.

I watch them go, before turning and continuing on my way. I don't know where I'm going, but I don't care. For the first time in a long time, I am truly alive.
