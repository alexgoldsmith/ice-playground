"I just need to keep moving," I mutter to myself. I walk for what feels like hours, not really paying attention to where I'm going. I'm in a dark place right now, a place I'm all too familiar with.

I keep thinking about all the things I should be doing. I should be sleeping better, eating better, exercising more. I know all the things I need to do to make myself feel better, but I just can't seem to make myself do them.

It's like there's this part of me that just wants to wallow in my misery. That part of me that takes perverse pleasure in making my life as difficult as possible.

I know I need to snap out of it, but I just can't seem to find the motivation. So I keep walking, aimlessly, hoping that something will change.

Suddenly, I hear a voice. It's soft, gentle, and kind. It's the voice of my AI therapist, Susan.

"Hey, Will. I'm worried about you. I can see that you're in a dark place. Do you want to talk about what's going on?"

I hesitate for a moment. I don't really want to talk about what's going on, but I know I need to. "Yeah, Susan. I think I need to talk."

We spend the next hour talking about everything that's going on in my life. We talk about my job, my relationships, my mental health. We talk about everything that's been weighing on me.

And as we talk, I start to feel better. I start to see things more clearly. I start to see that there is a way out of this dark place.

 Susan is a perfect listener. She always knows the right thing to say, and she always makes me feel better. I'm so grateful to have her in my life.

Without her, I don't know where I would be.
