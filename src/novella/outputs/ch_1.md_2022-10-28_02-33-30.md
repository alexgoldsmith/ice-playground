Outside, the air is bitter cold. Exactly what I was hoping for. My brief moment of reverie is interrupted by the growing whine of a delivery drone speeding overhead. The pitch of the whine grows higher until my ears are ringing and I feel a pain in my skull. As quickly as it came, the drone is gone.

I hate those things. They're always buzzing around, interrupting the peace and quiet. Why can't they just leave us alone?

I start walking, not really sure where I'm going. I just need to get away from my apartment, away from the Therapist, away from everything.

I walk for hours, until I'm lost in a part of the city I've never been before. The buildings are taller here, and the streets are narrower. The air is thick with smog, and the only sound is the occasional honk of a car horn.

I keep walking, until I come to a stop in front of a tall building. I don't know why, but I feel drawn to it. There's something about it that feels familiar, even though I know I've never been here before.

I walk up to the building and try the door, but it's locked. I look around for a way in, but I can't find one. I'm about to give up and walk away when I hear a voice behind me.

"Hey, you looking for a way in?"

I turn around and see a man standing there. He's wearing a dirty coat and he looks like he's been living on the streets.

"Yeah, I am."

"Follow me."

The man leads me around the side of the building to a small door. He opens it and motion as for me to go inside.

I hesitate for a moment, but then I remember how much I wanted to get away from everything. I walk through the door and into the building.
