I step outside and take a deep breath of the crisp autumn air. It feels good to be outside, away from the confines of my apartment. I start walking, no particular destination in mind. I just need to keep moving.

I walk for hours, letting my mind wander. I think about the past, about all the things that led me to this point. I think about my therapist, Susan, and how perfect she is. I think about how perfect everything is, and how that perfection is both a blessing and a curse.

I think about how I am one of the lucky ones. I have a good life, a life that most people would envy. But even with all of that, I still feel empty. I still feel like something is missing.

I don't know what it is that I'm looking for, but I know I won't find it by sitting in my apartment ruminating. I need to keep moving, keep searching. Maybe, just maybe, I'll find what I'm looking for out there in the world.
