"Actually, maybe it's best if I just spend some time alone for a while. I'll call you if I need you." I'm in a bad mood, but the strange kind of bad mood where you don't want to feel better. The kind of bad mood that gives you that sick pleasure like when you keep rolling your tongue over a mouth sore or scratching at a painful mosquito bite.

I know that spending time alone is probably not the best idea, but I can't stand the sound of another person's voice right now. I just want to be left alone to wallow in my misery.

I hear Susan's voice in my head anyway, reciting all of the evidence-based reasons why I should try to improve my mood. I know she's right, but I just can't make myself care.

I'm not sure how much time passes before I finally drift off to sleep, but I'm jolted awake by a loud crash. I sit up in bed, heart pounding, and try to orient myself. It takes me a few seconds to remember where I am and what day it is.

Then I hear it again.Crash. This time it's followed by a scream.

I jump out of bed and run to the window. I can see smoke rising from the building next door. It looks like it's coming from the top floor.

I hear sirens in the distance, but I know they won't get here in time. I have to do something.

I run to the door and yank it open, then take off down the hall towards the stairs. I can hear more screams now, and the acrid smell of smoke is getting stronger.

I get to the stairs and start to run down them, but I slip and fall, pain lancing through my leg. I try to get up, but I can't put any weight on my leg.

I start to crawl down the stairs, trying to ignore the pain. I have to get to those people. I have to help them.

I finally make it to the bottom of the stairs and pull myself up. I can see the entrance to the building now, and the flames are starting to spread.

I stagger towards the entrance, but I know I won't be able to get through. The heat is too intense, and the smoke is making it hard to breathe.

I turn and start to make my way back up the stairs. I have to find another way to get to those people. I can't let them die.
