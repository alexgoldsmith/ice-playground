I walk quickly, trying to outpace the drone. But it follows me, the sound of its engines growing louder and more irritating. Finally, I can't take it anymore and I duck into an alleyway, pressing my back against the cold brick wall and waiting for the drone to pass.

It hovers there for a moment, as if it knows I'm hiding. And then, to my relief, it continues on its way.
