"The pitch of the whine grows higher until my ears are ringing and I feel a pain in my skull. As quickly as it came, the drone is gone."

I walk to the edge of the sidewalk and look up. The drone is already a tiny speck in the sky, disappearing into the distance.

I try not to think about the fact that, in a few years, those things will be everywhere. Autonomous, flying robots, deliverying packages and food and who knows what else. They say it will make our lives easier, but I can't help but feel like it will make us more isolated. More alone.

I shake my head and keep walking. I need to clear my head. I can't keep dwelling on these things or I'll go crazy.
