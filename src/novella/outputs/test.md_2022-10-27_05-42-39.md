I can't help but wince as the delivery drone zooms overhead. The ringing in my ears is becoming unbearable, and the pain in my skull is intensifying. I know I should head back inside, but something keeps me rooted to the spot.

The drone suddenly changes course and starts heading straight for me. I panic and start to run, but it's too late. The drone collides with me and I am knocked to the ground. I hear a faint beeping noise as the drone flies away.

I try to get up, but my body feels heavy and my vision is blurred. I realize that I have been hit with a tranquilizer dart. As the world starts to fade away, I see a figure in the distance, watching me. Then everything goes black.
