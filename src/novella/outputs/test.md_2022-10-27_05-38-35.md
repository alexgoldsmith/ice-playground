I shield my eyes from the sun as the drone passes overhead. It's a tiny, black speck against the bright blue sky. I can barely make out the letters on the side: AMAZON. Just another reminder that the world is changing, and not always for the better.

I shiver and pull my coat tighter around me. I walk aimlessly for a while, letting the cold numbs my thoughts. I don't know where I'm going, but I feel better being out in the open.

After a while, I find myself in front of a small park. It's empty, except for a single figure sitting on a bench. It's a woman, and she looks to be about my age. She's wearing a long, white dress that stands out in stark contrast to the drab gray of the concrete and the grass.

I walk over to the bench and sit down. The woman looks at me, but she doesn't say anything. We sit in silence for a while, enjoying the peace of the park.

Finally, the woman speaks. "It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"

I look at her, surprised. I hadn't expected her to say anything. "Yes, it is."

"I'm sorry if I startled you. I just wanted to enjoy the silence for a while. It's been so noisy lately, with the drones and the cars and the phones."

I nod. I know what she means. It's hard to find peace in a world that's always moving, always making noise. "I'm Will, by the way."

"I'm Sarah," the woman says.

We sit in silence for a while longer, enjoying the peace of the park.
