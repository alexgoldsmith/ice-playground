I grab my coat. I'm hoping it is cold outside. It's early October, but the air has carried an early chill the last few days.

I step outside and take a deep breath. The cold air feels good in my lungs. I walk briskly down the street, enjoying the feeling of being alive.

I turn the corner and see her. She's walking towards me, and I can't help but feel a rush of excitement. I quicken my pace, and soon we are walking side by side.

"Hey," I say, not able to hide the grin on my face.

"Hey," she replies, looking up at me with those beautiful eyes.

We walk together in silence for a while, enjoying each other's company. Finally, she speaks.

"So, what's been going on with you?"

I take a deep breath and tell her everything. About my therapist, my job, my anxiety, my boredom. I tell her everything, and she listens.

When I'm finished, she looks at me and smiles. "It sounds like you're doing really well, despite everything."

I nod, and we continue walking. I feel lighter now, like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I know that I can face anything, as long as she's by my side.
