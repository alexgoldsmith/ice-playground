"Yo, Jay, what's up brother?"

"I just got buzzed by a flier. Right overhead. Heading north on Roman Avenue. Think I could borrow a netter?"

"Yeah, no problem. I'm headed that way now. I'll be there in a few."

I walk to the edge of the roof and sit down, letting my legs dangle over the edge. It's a cool night, and the city is alive with lights and movement. I love watching people, even though I'm not really supposed to.

I see the drone first, a dark shape against the night sky. It's coming in low and fast, and I know it's going to hit me. I brace myself for the impact, but it never comes.

Instead, there is a bright flash of light and a loud bang, and the drone falls to the ground in front of me, smoking and sparking.

"What the hell?"

I stand up and look around, but there's no sign of whoever shot the drone down. I can't even tell where the shot came from.

" Jay! Are you okay?"

I glance over to see Zee coming towards me, a worried look on his face.

"Yeah, I'm fine. But what the hell just happened?"

"I don't know. But we should probably get out of here before whoever did this comes back."

We take the stairs down to the street and start walking away from the scene of the crime.

"Do you think they were trying to kill you?" asks Zee.

"I don't know. But I think we should go to the police and tell them what happened."

"I don't know, Jay. This seems like it could be bad for us. We're already on their radar as it is."

"I know, but we can't just ignore this. Someone took a shot at me. We need to find out who did it and why."

Zee doesn't look convinced, but he doesn't argue with me either.

"All right, Jay. We'll go to the police. But we're not going to tell them everything, got it?"

"Yeah, got it."

We flag down a cab and head to the police station. I have a feeling this is going to be a long night.
