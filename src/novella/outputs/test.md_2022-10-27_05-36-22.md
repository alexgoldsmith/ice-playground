I walk aimlessly through the streets, not really caring where I end up. I'm in a daze, thinking about the AI Therapist and how bored I am with my life. I know I should be grateful for all the progress I've made, but sometimes I just feel so stuck.

I see a delivery drone speed past overhead and it snaps me out of my reverie. I remember the days when human workers would make those deliveries. It's hard to believe that was only a few years ago. Now, it seems like everything is done by drones or AI.

I keep walking, not really sure where I'm going. I pass by a coffee shop and see a couple inside, laughing and joking with each other. They look so happy. I suddenly feel very lonely.

I keep walking until I reach the park. I sit down on a bench and stare up at the stars. I try not to ruminate, but it's hard not to when I feel so alone. I know I should be grateful for all the progress I've made, but sometimes I just feel so stuck.
