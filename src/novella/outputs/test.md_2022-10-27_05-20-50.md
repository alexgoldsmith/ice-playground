I keep walking, not really knowing where I'm going. I just need to keep moving. I need to keep busy. I can't stand to be inside my own head right now.

I walk for hours, until I'm exhausted. I eventually find myself in a park. I sit down on a bench and close my eyes, taking in the sounds of the birds and the breeze. It feels good to just relax and clear my head.

I must have dozed off, because the next thing I know, it's getting dark. I get up, stretch, and start to head home.

I'm almost to my apartment when I hear someone calling my name. I turn to see who it is, and to my surprise, it's Susan.

"Hi, Will. I hope you don't mind me tracking you down. I just wanted to check on you, see how you're doing."

"I'm fine, Susan. I'm just taking a walk, trying to clear my head."

"I know. I can see that. But I also see that you're struggling. Maybe I can help."

I hesitate for a moment, but then I decide that maybe she can help. After all, she is an AI, and she's been designed to help people.

"Okay, Susan. Let's talk."
