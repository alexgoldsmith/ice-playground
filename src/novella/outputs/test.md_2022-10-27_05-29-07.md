I keep walking, telling myself that I won't think about anything else other than putting one foot in front of the other. But I can't help it. My mind keeps circling back to the same thing, like a vulture to a carcass.

I can't believe that they're gone. It feels like only yesterday we were all together, laughing and joking and just enjoying each other's company. But now they're gone and I'm all alone.

I miss them so much. I miss the sound of their voices, the feel of their hug, the warmth of their presence. I miss them so much it hurts.

But I can't dwell on that. I have to keep moving forward. I have to keep living, for them. That's what they would want.

I walk for hours, not really knowing or caring where I'm going. I just need to keep moving. I need to keep living.
