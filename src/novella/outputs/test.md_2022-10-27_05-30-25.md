I keep walking, aimless but purposeful. I need to keep moving. I can't stand to be still.

A movement catches the corner of my eye. I tense up, my whole body on alert. I scan my surroundings, looking for the source of the movement.

It's a cat. A small, scrawny black cat. It looks up at me with its big, green eyes, and then mews pitifully.

I relax, my body uncoiling like a spring. I didn't even realize I was so tense. I'm about to keep walking when something stops me.

I bend down and pick up the cat. It's so light, almost weightless. I cradle it in my arms and start walking again, this time with a destination in mind.

I'm not sure what made me pick up the cat. Maybe it was the way it looked at me, or maybe I just needed the companionship. Either way, I'm glad I did.
