"Actually, maybe it's best if I just spend some time alone for a while. I'll call you if I need you." I'm in a bad mood, but the strange kind of bad mood where you don't want to feel better. The kind of bad mood that gives you that sick pleasure like when you keep rolling your tongue over a mouth sore or scratching at a painful mosquito bite.

 Susan understands what I need better than I do. "Of course, Will. I'll be here if you need me."

I spend the next few hours isolating myself in my room. I don't want to talk to anyone, not even Susan. I just want to be alone with my thoughts.

As the day wears on, my bad mood turns into a full-blown funk. I start to feel sorry for myself. I think about all the things that have gone wrong in my life. I dwell on my failures. I ruminate on my regrets.

Before I know it, hours have passed and it's getting late. I'm exhausted, both mentally and emotionally. I know I need to snap out of it, but I just can't seem to shake this funk.

I decide to call Susan.

"Hi, Will. I'm glad you called," she says.

"I'm not," I say. "I feel terrible."

"I can see that," Susan says. "Tell me what's going on."

And so I do. I pour out my heart to her. I tell her everything that's been bugging me. I tell her about my fears and my doubts. I tell her about my insecurities and my failures.

"It sounds like you're going through a tough time," she says.

"Yeah, I guess I am," I say.

"I'm here for you, Will. We'll get through this together."

Somehow, just hearing her say that makes me feel a little better. I'm not sure if it's her words or her tone or just the fact that she's there for me, but I suddenly feel less alone.

"Thanks, Susan," I say.

"Anytime, Will. Anytime."
