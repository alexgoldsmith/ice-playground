I walk through the door and into the building. The man leads me down a dark hallway and into a small room. There's a bed in the corner and a man is lying on it. He's hooked up to a machines and looks like he's in a coma.

"What is this place?" I ask the man.

"It's a place for people who can't go on living", he says. "People who have given up."

I look at the man on the bed and then back at the man who led me here. "Is this what you want?" I ask him. "To just give up and die?"

"No", he says. "But sometimes it feels like there's no other choice."

I sit down on the bed next to the man and take his hand. " There's always another choice", I tell him. "You just have to be brave enough to see it."
