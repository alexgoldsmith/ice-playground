I try not to ruminate as I walk. It's a bad habit of mine, though my therapist tells me I am making great progress. Still, it seems like I have so much time on my hands, and boredom has so often been a trigger for my depression.

I pass by a delivery drone on the sidewalk and try to ignore the ringing in my ears. I appreciate the early chill in the air, though it does little to ease my mind. Perhaps a walk will do me some good.

I'm not sure where I'm going, but I feel better with each step I take. The fresh air does me some good, and I start to feel less like a caged animal. I take a seat on a bench and take in my surroundings.

I see a group of people laughing and joking around a few yards away from me. It looks like they're playing some sort of game. I watch them for a while, feeling a twinge of jealousy. I wish I could be like them, carefree and happy. But I know that's not who I am.

I pull out my phone and check the time. It's getting late, and I should head home. I'll call Susan tomorrow and see if she can help me find something to do with my time. For now, I'm just going to enjoy the peace and quiet.
