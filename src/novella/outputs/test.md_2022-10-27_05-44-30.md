The pain in my skull grows more intense, and I see spots in front of my eyes. I stumble to the side and fall to my knees, clutching at my head. The delivery drone zooms past me and disappears around a corner.

I stay there for a moment, trying to catch my breath and waiting for the pain to subside. Slowly, it ebbs away, leaving behind a dull ache. I get to my feet and brush myself off.

I've had enough of this world. I'm tired of being alone, tired of being treated like a lab rat. I'm done with all of it.

I walk away from my apartment, not knowing where I'm going or what I'll do next. But I know one thing for sure: I'm never going back.
