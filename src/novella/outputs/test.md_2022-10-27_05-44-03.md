I can't help but wince as the drone whizzes by, its high-pitched whine painfully piercing my ears. I shield my eyes from the bright light of the sun, trying to spot the drone as it disappears into the distance.

I'm not sure where I'm going, but I suddenly feel as if I can't stand to be in my apartment a moment longer. I grab my coat and head outside, hoping that the cold air will help clear my head.

As I walk, I can't help but notice the increasing number of delivery drones flying overhead. It seems like everywhere I look, there's another one, zipping by at breakneck speed.

The constant drone of the engines is starting to give me a headache, and I can't help but wonder if this is really the future we want.
