I can't take it anymore. I have to get out of here.

I start walking and don't stop until I reach the edge of the city. I sit down on the ground and stare up at the stars. I used to love looking at the stars. It was one of the few things that made me feel small and insignificant in the best way possible. But now they just remind me of how vast and empty the universe is.

I stay there until the sun comes up. Then I get up and start walking back to my apartment. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I know I can't keep living like this.
