I walk down the street, trying to clear my head. The cold air feels good, numbing my skin. I hear the drone before I see it, a high-pitched whine that sets my teeth on edge. It's coming straight for me and I know I won't be able to get out of the way in time.

I close my eyes and brace myself for the impact. But it never comes. I open my eyes to see the drone hovering inches from my face, a small package clasped in its metal claws. I take the package and the drone zips away, disappearing into the sky.

I tear open the package and find a book inside. The title is "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". I flip to the first page and begin to read.
