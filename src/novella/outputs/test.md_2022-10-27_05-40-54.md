I walk swiftly, trying to lose myself in the cold. The drone's whine fades into the background as I focus on the crunch of my boots on the ground. I pass other people on the sidewalks, but I don't make eye contact. I don't want to be drawn into conversation. I just want to be alone.

I wander for hours, not really sure where I'm going. I find myself in unfamiliar neighborhoods, and eventually I start to feel lost. But I don't care. I keep walking, enjoying the anonymity of being just another person in a busy city.

The sun starts to set and I realize I'm hungry. I hadn't eaten all day. I find a food truck and order a burger. I sit on a bench and eat, watching the people around me. I'm not really paying attention to them, but I like the feeling of being surrounded by people. It makes me feel less alone.

As the sky grows dark, I start to head back home. I'm tired and cold, but I feel better than I did when I left. Maybe it was good to get out after all.
