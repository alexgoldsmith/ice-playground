"I'm in a bad mood, but the strange kind of bad mood where you don't want to feel better. The kind of bad mood that gives you that sick pleasure like when you keep rolling your tongue over a mouth sore or scratching at a painful mosquito bite.

I grab my coat. I'm hoping it is cold outside. It's early october, but the air has carried an early chill the last few days. I don't know where I am going but I suddenly feel as if I can't stand a moment longer in my apartment.

I step outside and take a deep breath of cold air. It feels good to be out of the stuffy apartment. I start walking, not really sure where I'm going. I just need to keep moving.

I'm not sure how long I've been walking but I eventually find myself in a park. I sit down on a bench and take in my surroundings. The leaves on the trees are just starting to change color and the air is crisp. It's actually really peaceful here.

I close my eyes and take a deep breath. For a moment, I forget all my troubles. I just focus on the sounds of the leaves rustling in the wind and the sound of birds chirping. It's nice to just relax and clear my head for a bit.

After a while, I start to feel better. The bad mood has lifted and I'm feeling more like myself again. I get up from the bench and walk back home, feeling grateful for the moment of peace I found in the park."
