"What is this place?" I ask the man.

"This is the future", he says. "A future where everything is controlled by machines. Where people are nothing more than cogs in the machine. Life is nothing but a simulation."

I looks around the room, taking in the machines and the man lying in the bed. I can't believe what I'm hearing.

"But why?" I ask. "Why would anyone want to live in a world like this?"

"Some people think it's better this way", the man says. "They think it's easier. But they're wrong. This world is a prison. A prison for our minds."

I can't believe what I'm hearing. I want to leave this place, but at the same time, I'm curious to know more.

"How do you know all this?" I ask.

"I designed this place", the man says. "I created the machines. I'm the one who designed the simulation."

"Why?" I ask. "Why would you do all this?"

"It was a mistake", the man says. "I was trying to create a utopia, but I failed. I only created a prison. A prison for our minds."
