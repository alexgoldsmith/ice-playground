The man leads me down a dark hallway and into a small room. There's a bed in the corner and a man is lying on it. He's hooked up to a machines and looks like he's in a coma.

"What is this place?" I ask the man.

"It's a research facility. We're working on a new treatment for coma patients."

"What kind of treatment?"

"It's a long shot, but we're hoping to be able to restore consciousness."

I look at the man on the bed and feel a surge of hope. If they can find a way to help him, then maybe there's hope for me too.

I spend the next few hours talking to the man and learn that his name is Tom. He tells me about his life before he fell into the coma and I feel like I'm getting to know him.

Eventually, the man has to leave and I'm left alone in the room with Tom. I sit with him for a while, just talking to him and hoping that somehow, he can hear me.

I don't know how long I sit there, but eventually I fall asleep. I'm not sure if it's the exhaustion from all the walking or the emotional toll of the day, but I do know that I feel better than I have in a long time.

When I wake up, I'm not sure what to expect. But when I see Tom lying there, still in a coma, I can't help but feel disappointed.

I know it's silly, but I can't help but feel like I've let him down. I was so sure that I could help him, but I guess I was wrong.

I sit with him for a while longer, until I'm finally able to drag myself away. I don't know if I'll ever come back, but I do know that I won't give up on Tom. I'll find a way to help him, even if it's the last thing I do.
