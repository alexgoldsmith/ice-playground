I speak to the air. "Zee, this is Jay. Pickup if you can." A heartbeat passes and I hear a telltale ding in my ear.

"Yo, Jay, what's up brother?"

"I just got buzzed by a flier. Right overhead. Heading north on Bowman Avenue. Think I could borrow a netter?"

"Yeah, I can send one your way. ETA about five minutes."

I thank him and disconnect the call. I pull my coat tight around me and keep walking.
