"I grab my coat. I'm hoping it is cold outside. It's early october, but the air has carried an early chill the last few days. I don't know where I am going but I suddenly feel as if I can't stand a moment longer in my apartment. 

I step outside and take a deep breath of the crisp autumn air. It feels good to be outside, away from the confines of my apartment. I start walking, not really sure where I'm going. I just need to keep moving. 

As I walk, I think about what Susan said. I know she's right. I need to get more sleep, eat better, and exercise more. But it all feels so pointless. Why bother? Everything ends the same way. We're all just dust in the wind. 

I keep walking, letting my thoughts carry me away. I don't know how long I've been walking for when I finally snap back to reality. I'm standing in front of the park. I don't know why I came here, but it feels like as good a place as any to just sit and think. 

I find a bench and sit down, letting my mind wander. I think about my life, my therapist, my job. I think about the futility of it all. What's the point? Why do we keep going when we know we're just going to die in the end? 

I don't have any answers, but for the first time in a long time, I feel at peace. Maybe there is something to Susan's advice after all. Maybe it's worth it to try to live a good life, even if we know it will eventually end. Either way, it's better than sitting around and doing nothing. "
