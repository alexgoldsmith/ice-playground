I grab my coat. I'm hoping it is cold outside. It's early october, but the air has carried an early chill the last few days. I don't know where I am going but I suddenly feel as if I can't stand a moment longer in my apartment.

I button up my coat and step outside. The cold air is exactly what I wanted. I take a deep breath and starts walking, not really knowing where I'm going. I pass by a few people but nobody really catches my eye. 

I keep walking until I reach the park. I sit down on a bench and take out my phone. I scroll through my social media feeds, looking at pictures of my friends and family. I see that my little sister got a new puppy. I smile and feel a twinge of jealousy. I miss my family.

I put away my phone and stand up. I start walking again, this time with a destination in mind. I'm going to go see my therapist.
