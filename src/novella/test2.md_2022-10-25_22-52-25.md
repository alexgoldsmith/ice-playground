"Actually, maybe it's best if I just spend some time alone for a while. I'll call you if I need you." I'm in a bad mood, but the strange kind of bad mood where you don't want to feel better. The kind of bad mood that gives you that sick pleasure like when you keep rolling your tongue over a mouth sore or scratching at a painful mosquito bite.

I know that Susan will be there for me if I need her, but right now I just want to wallow in my misery. I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it. It feels good in a strange, masochistic way.

I spend the next few hours just lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling. I don't even bother getting up to eat or use the bathroom. I just want to stay in this dark place for a while.

Eventually, I do get up, but only because I have to pee. As I walk to the bathroom, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and I'm shocked at what I see.

I look like a fucking mess. My hair is a tangled mess, my eyes are red and puffy from crying, and I just look generally haggard. I look like I've aged 10 years in the past few hours.

I splash some cold water on my face and try to make myself look presentable, but it's no use. I look like shit and there's nothing I can do about it.

I trudge back to my bed and flop down, burying my face in my pillow. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I just want to stay in this dark place forever.
