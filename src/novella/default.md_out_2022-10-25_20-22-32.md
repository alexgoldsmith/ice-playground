I can't see any other buildings from my window, which is probably why I chose this apartment. I like feeling like I'm the only person for miles, even though I know I'm not.

I'm not sure what it is that I'm looking for, but I know I'll know it when I see it. I've been searching for something for a long time, and I'm not sure what it is. But I hope that, whatever it is, I'll find it soon.
