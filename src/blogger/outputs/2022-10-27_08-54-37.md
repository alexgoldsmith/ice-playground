    3. Background information on precision medicine
    4. Overview of main points
    
2. Body Paragraph 1
    1. Point: The cost of precision medicine may exacerbate healthcare inequalities.
    2. Support 1: The cost of precision medicine treatments may be too high for some patients to afford.
    3. Support 2: The cost of precision medicine treatments may also lead to less funding for other important healthcare initiatives.
    4. Rebuttal: Precision medicine may actually help to lower the cost of healthcare overall by preventing the need for more expensive treatments down the line.
    5. Conclusion: The cost of precision medicine is a significant concern that needs to be addressed in order to prevent exacerbating healthcare inequalities.

3. Body Paragraph 2
    1. Point: The implementation of precision medicine may lead to a decline in population health.
    2. Support 1: Precision medicine treatments may only be available to a small subset of the population.
    3. Support 2: The focus on precision medicine may lead to a decline in funding for other important healthcare initiatives.
    4. Rebuttal: Precision medicine may actually help to improve population health by identifying at-risk populations and targeting interventions to them.
    5. Conclusion: Whether or not precision medicine leads to a decline in population health depends on how it is implemented, but there is potential for it to have a negative impact.

4. Body Paragraph 3
    1. Point: The implementation of precision medicine may lead to a decline in the quality of healthcare.
    2. Support 1: The focus on precision medicine may lead to a decline in funding for other important healthcare initiatives.
    3. Support 2: The implementation of precision medicine may lead to a decline in the number of healthcare providers.
    4. Rebuttal: Precision medicine may actually help to improve the quality of healthcare by providing tailored treatments to patients.
    5. Conclusion: Whether or not precision medicine leads to a decline in the quality of healthcare depends on how it is implemented, but there is potential for it to have a negative impact.

5. Body Paragraph 4
    1. Point: The implementation of precision medicine may have ethical implications.
    2. Support 1: The use of precision medicine may lead to a decline in the quality of life for some patients.
    3. Support 2: The use of precision medicine may lead to unnecessary treatments for some patients.
    4. Rebuttal: Precision medicine may actually help to improve the quality of life for patients by providing tailored treatments to them.
    5. Conclusion: Whether or not precision medicine has ethical implications depends on how it is implemented, but there is potential for it to have a negative impact.

    3. Call to action or final thoughts

As we move towards a more precision medicine approach to healthcare, it is important to consider the potential risks and implications associated with this shift. Although precision medicine has the potential to improve population health, there are several risks associated with its implementation that must be addressed.

One of the key concerns with precision medicine is the cost. The cost of precision medicine treatments may be too high for some patients to afford, which could exacerbate healthcare inequalities. In addition, the cost of precision medicine may lead to less funding for other important healthcare initiatives. However, it is important to note that precision medicine may actually help to lower the cost of healthcare overall by preventing the need for more expensive treatments down the line.

Another potential risk associated with precision medicine is that the implementation may lead to a decline in population health. Precision medicine treatments may only be available to a small subset of the population, and the focus on precision medicine may lead to a decline in funding for other important healthcare initiatives. However, precision medicine may actually help to improve population health by identifying at-risk populations and targeting interventions to them.

Finally, the implementation of precision medicine may also have implications for the quality of healthcare. The focus on precision medicine may lead to a decline in funding for other important healthcare initiatives, and the implementation of precision medicine may lead to a decline in the number of healthcare providers. However, precision medicine may actually help to improve the quality of healthcare by providing tailored treatments to patients.

Whether precision medicine ultimately improves population health or leads to a decline in the quality of healthcare depends on how it is implemented. There are potential risks associated with precision medicine, but there is also potential for it to have a positive impact. It is important to consider these risks and implications as we move forward with precision medicine.
