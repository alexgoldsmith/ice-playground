    3. Background information on AI in music
    4. Overview of main points

2. Body Paragraph 1
    1. Point: AI will lead to the loss of jobs for musicians.
    2. Support 1: AI could be used to create music, which would lead to a decrease in the need for human musicians.
    3. Support 2: AI could also be used to distribute and promote music, which would lead to a decrease in the need for human musicians.
    4. Rebuttal: AI could help musicians by giving them more time to focus on other tasks or by providing them with instant feedback on their work.
    5. Conclusion: While AI may have some potential benefits for musicians, it also poses a threat to their jobs.

3. Body Paragraph 2
    1. Point: AI will lead to a decrease in the quality of music.
    2. Support 1: If AI is used to create music, the results will be inferior to music created by humans.
    3. Support 2: AI could also be used to grade music, which would lead to a decreased value being placed on human creativity.
    4. Rebuttal: AI could help musicians to create better music by providing them with instant feedback on their work.
    5. Conclusion: While there is potential for AI to help musicians create better music, there is also a risk that it will lead to a decrease in the overall quality of music.

4. Body Paragraph 3
    1. Point: AI will lead to a more standardized form of music.
    2. Support 1: If AI is used to create music, it will likely follow certain patterns and formulas that are easy for the computer to replicate.
    3. Support 2: AI could also be used to distribute and promote music, which would lead to a more standardized sound being promoted.
    4. Rebuttal: AI could help musicians to create more individualized music by giving them more freedom to experiment.
    5. Conclusion: While there is potential for AI to help musicians create more individualized music, there is also a risk that it will lead to a more standardized sound.

5. Body Paragraph 4
    1. Point: The implications of AI in the music industry extend beyond the loss of jobs for musicians.
    2. Support 1: AI has the potential to change the power dynamics in the music industry, with major labels and producers having less control over the final product.
    3. Support 2: AI could also lead to a more democratized form of music, with anyone being able to create and distribute their own songs.
    4. Rebuttal: AI could actually help to control the spread of pirated music and make it more difficult for people to access unauthorized copies of songs.
    5. Conclusion: While there are some potential positives to AI in the music industry, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm musicians and devalue human creativity.

6. Conclusion
    1. Restate thesis statement
    2. Summarize main points
    3. Call to action or final thoughts

The music industry is facing a major upheaval as artificial intelligence (AI) begins to enter the scene. Although AI promises to disrupt the music industry, there are several risks associated with its implementation that must be addressed, including the loss of jobs for musicians, a decrease in the quality of music, and a more standardized form of music.

AI poses a threat to musicians' jobs because it can be used to create music, distribute and promote music, and provide feedback on musicians' work. This automation of the music industry will lead to a decrease in the need for human musicians. Additionally, AI could be used to grade music, which would lead to a decreased value being placed on human creativity.

The implications of AI in the music industry extend beyond the loss of jobs for musicians. AI has the potential to change the power dynamics in the music industry, with major labels and producers having less control over the final product. AI could also lead to a more democratized form of music, with anyone being able to create and distribute their own songs. However, AI could also be used to control the spread of pirated music and make it more difficult for people to access unauthorized copies of songs.

Overall, the negative implications of AI in the music industry outweigh the positives. The loss of jobs for musicians, the decrease in the quality of music, and the more standardized form of music that is likely to result from AI's presence in the industry are all major concerns. If these issues are not addressed, AI could do more harm than good in the music industry.
