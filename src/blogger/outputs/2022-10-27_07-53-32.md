1. Introduction
    1. Attention-grabbing opening
    2. Thesis statement: The copyright implications of AI generated art and writing are largely negative because it is difficult to protect the work of machines and this could lead to a loss of revenue for human artists and writers.
    3. Background information on AI generated art and writing
    4. Overview of main points

2. Body Paragraph 1
    1. Point: AI generated art and writing is difficult to protect under copyright law.
    2. Support 1: Copyright law is based on the idea of originality, which is hard to prove with machine-generated art and writing.
    3. Support 2: Even if the work is found to be original, it is often difficult to determine who owns the copyright to it - the human who created the algorithm or the machine itself?
    4. Rebuttal: Some argue that AI generated art and writing should be protected under existing copyright law, but this is not yet supported by evidence.
    5. Conclusion: Overall, AI generated art and writing is difficult to protect under copyright law.

3. Body Paragraph 2
    1. Point: The lack of copyright protection for AI generated art and writing threatens to replace human creators and lead to a loss of revenue.
    2. Support 1: If people can't copyright AI generated art and writing, they are less likely to create it. 
    3. Support 2: If people can't copyright AI generated art and writing, they are also less likely to sell it or make money from it. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some believe that AI generated art and writing will never be able to fully replace human creators because machines lack empathy and emotionality. 
    5. Conclusion: While it is possible that AI might not completely replace human creators, it still poses a threat to their livelihoods as it continues to develop.

4. Body Paragraph 3
    1. Point: The implications of the lack of copyright protection for AI generated art and writing extend beyond the loss of revenue for human creators.
    2. Support 1: AI generated art and writing could lead to a homogenization of culture as machine-made art and writing becomes more prevalent. 
    3. Support 2: If people can't copyright AI generated art and writing, they may start to value it less overall. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some argue that AI generated art and writing can actually help to diversify culture by giving underrepresented groups a platform to create and share their own art and writing. 
    5.Conclusion: While there are some potential positives to AI generated art and writing, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm society and devalue human creativity.

5. Conclusion
    1. Restate thesis statement
    2. Summarize main points
    3. Call to action or final thoughts

1. Introduction
    
    1. Opening: We are quickly approaching a future in which artificial intelligence (AI) will have a profound impact on many aspects of our lives - including art and writing.
    2. Thesis statement: The copyright implications of AI generated art and writing are largely negative because it is difficult to protect the work of machines and this could lead to a loss of revenue for human artists and writers.
    3. Background information on AI generated art and writing: AI generated art and writing is a new and growing field in which machines create works of art and writing without any human input.
    4. Overview of main points: In this essay, we will explore the copyright implications of AI generated art and writing. We will argue that the lack of copyright protection for AI generated art and writing is largely negative because it is difficult to protect the work of machines and this could lead to a loss of revenue for human artists and writers.

5. Conclusion
    
    1. Restate thesis statement: The copyright implications of AI generated art and writing are largely negative because it is difficult to protect the work of machines and this could lead to a loss of revenue for human artists and writers.
    2. Summarize main points: We have argued that the lack of copyright protection for AI generated art and writing is largely negative because it is difficult to protect the work of machines and this could lead to a loss of revenue for human artists and writers. We have also explored the implications of this lack of protection, which extend beyond the loss of revenue for human creators and could lead to a homogenization of culture and a devaluation of human creativity.
    3. Call to action or final thoughts: Given the potential negative implications of the lack of copyright protection for AI generated art and writing, it is important that we find a way to protect the work of human creators. Otherwise, we risk losing a valuable part of our culture and heritage.
