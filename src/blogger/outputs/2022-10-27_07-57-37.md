    1. Point: The use of AI in warfare could lead to greater civilian casualties.
    2. Support 1: If AI is used to select targets, there is a greater risk of innocent civilians being killed.
    3. Support 2: AI weapons are less discriminate than human soldiers, so they are more likely to cause collateral damage.
    4. Rebuttal: Some believe that AI could actually help to reduce civilian casualties by making warfare more precise.
    5. Conclusion: Overall, the use of AI in warfare is likely to lead to greater civilian casualties.

    1. Point: The use of AI in warfare could lead to an increased risk of global conflict.
    2. Support 1: If countries feel like they need to compete with each other in terms of AI technology, this could lead to an arms race.
    3. Support 2: The use of AI in warfare could lead to a destabilization of the international system.
    4. Rebuttal: Some believe that the use of AI in warfare could actually help to prevent global conflict by deterring countries from attacking each other.
    5. Conclusion: While there are some potential positives to the use of AI in warfare, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially lead to global conflict.

1. Introduction

According to a recent report by the United Nations, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in warfare is becoming increasingly common, and the implications of this trend are largely negative. Although the use of AI in warfare may have some benefits, the implications are largely negative because it could lead to greater civilian casualties and an increased risk of global conflict.

2. Body Paragraph 1

One of the main implications of the use of AI in warfare is that it could lead to greater civilian casualties. If AI is used to select targets, there is a greater risk of innocent civilians being killed. This is because AI weapons are less discriminate than human soldiers, so they are more likely to cause collateral damage. Some believe that AI could actually help to reduce civilian casualties by making warfare more precise. However, overall, the use of AI in warfare is likely to lead to greater civilian casualties.

3. Body Paragraph 2

Another implication of the use of AI in warfare is that it could lead to an increased risk of global conflict. If countries feel like they need to compete with each other in terms of AI technology, this could lead to an arms race. Additionally, the use of AI in warfare could lead to a destabilization of the international system. Some believe that the use of AI in warfare could actually help to prevent global conflict by deterring countries from attacking each other. However, the potential positives of AI in warfare are outweighed by the negatives because of the ways it could potentially lead to global conflict.

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of AI in warfare is becoming increasingly common, and the implications of this trend are largely negative. Although the use of AI in warfare may have some benefits, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could lead to greater civilian casualties and an increased risk of global conflict.
