2. Body Paragraph 1
    1. Point: The use of AI for education could lead to a loss of jobs for human teachers.
    2. Support 1: As AI gets better at teaching, there will be less need for human teachers. 
    3. Support 2: If people can't tell the difference between AI generated education and human-made education, they are less likely to value human teachers. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some believe that AI generated education will never be able to fully replace human teachers because machines lack empathy and emotionality. 
    5. Conclusion: While it is possible that AI might not completely replace human teachers, it still poses a threat to their livelihoods as it continues to develop.

3. Body Paragraph 2
    1. Point: The use of AI for education also threatens to dumb down education as a whole.
    2. Support 1: If education is left to machines, it will become more standardized and less individualized. 
    3. Support 2: Machines are not capable of critical thinking the way humans are, so they will not be able to teach higher level thinking skills. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some argue that the use of AI for education can actually help to improve education by making it more accessible and efficient. 
    5. Conclusion: While there are some potential positives to the use of AI for education, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm society and devalue human teachers.

4. Body Paragraph 3
    1. Point: The implications of the use of AI for education extend beyond the loss of jobs for human teachers.
    2. Support 1: The use of AI for education could lead to a homogenization of culture as machine-made education becomes more prevalent. 
    3. Support 2: If people can't tell the difference between AI generated education and human-made education, they may start to value education less overall. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some argue that the use of AI for education can actually help to diversify culture by giving underrepresented groups a platform to create and share their own art. 
    5. Conclusion: While there are some potential positives to the use of AI for education, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm society and devalue human teachers.

Introduction
    1. We are in the midst of an unprecedented technological revolution. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly transforming our world in ways that were once unthinkable. One area that has begun to feel the impact of AI is education. 
    2. Although the use of AI for education may have some benefits, the implications are largely negative because it threatens to replace human teachers and could lead to a loss of jobs in education. In this essay, we will explore the implications of the use of AI for education in more depth.

2. Body Paragraph 1
    1. The use of AI for education could lead to a loss of jobs for human teachers. As AI gets better at teaching, there will be less need for human teachers. This is already starting to happen in some places. For example, schools in China are using AI to teach English. In the future, it is possible that AI will be able to teach other subjects as well. 
    2. If people can't tell the difference between AI generated education and human-made education, they are less likely to value human teachers. This could lead to a decline in the demand for human teachers. 
    3. Some believe that AI generated education will never be able to fully replace human teachers because machines lack empathy and emotionality. However, as AI continues to develop, it is possible that it will become more sophisticated and be able to replicate these human qualities. 
    4. While it is possible that AI might not completely replace human teachers, it still poses a threat to their livelihoods as it continues to develop.

3. Body Paragraph 2
    1. The use of AI for education also threatens to dumb down education as a whole. If education is left to machines, it will become more standardized and less individualized. Standardization is not conducive to creativity and critical thinking. 
    2. Machines are not capable of critical thinking the way humans are, so they will not be able to teach higher level thinking skills. This could lead to a decline in the quality of education overall. 
    3. Some argue that the use of AI for education can actually help to improve education by making it more accessible and efficient. However, the negatives outweigh the positives in this case. 
    4. While there are some potential positives to the use of AI for education, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm society and devalue human teachers.

4. Body Paragraph 3
    1. The implications of the use of AI for education extend beyond the loss of jobs for human teachers. The use of AI for education could lead to a homogenization of culture as machine-made education becomes more prevalent. 
    2. If people can't tell the difference between AI generated education and human-made education, they may start to value education less overall. This would be a detrimental loss for society. 
    3. Some argue that the use of AI for education can actually help to diversify culture by giving underrepresented groups a platform to create and share their own art. However, the negatives outweigh the positives in this case. 
    4. While there are some potential positives to the use of AI for education, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm society and devalue human teachers.

5. Conclusion
    1. In conclusion, the use of AI for education may have some benefits, but the implications are largely negative. The use of AI for education threatens to replace human teachers and could lead to a loss of jobs in education. It also threatens to dumb down education as a whole and homogenize culture. 
    2. We must be careful as we move forward with the use of AI for education. We must consider the potential implications and make sure that we do not sacrifice too much in the name of efficiency or progress.
