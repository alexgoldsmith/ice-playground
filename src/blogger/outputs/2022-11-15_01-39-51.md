Creating a contact form doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, using Next.js and React makes it easy to create a form that is both user-friendly and responsive.

Next.js is a powerful JavaScript framework that makes it easy to create dynamic web applications. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Together, these two tools make it easy to create a contact form that is both user-friendly and responsive.

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a contact form with Next.js and React. First, Next.js provides a simple way to set up a contact form. Second, React makes it easy to add a responsive design to your contact form. And third, a contact form created with Next.js and React will be responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

With these things in mind, let's take a closer look at how to create a contact form using Next.js and React.

First, you'll need to create a new Next.js project. To do this, open a terminal window and enter the following command:

nextjs create my-project

This will create a new Next.js project in a directory called my-project.

Next, you'll need to install React and React-Dom. To do this, enter the following command in your terminal window:

npm install react react-dom

Now that you have a Next.js project set up and React installed, you're ready to start creating your contact form.

Open the file called pages/index.js in your text editor. This is where you'll write the code for your contact form.

First, you'll need to import React and React-Dom. To do this, add the following lines of code to the top of the file:

import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'

Next, you'll need to define a React component for your contact form. A React component is a piece of code that describes a part of a user interface.

To define a React component, you'll use a JavaScript function. This function will take two arguments: props and state.

Props are the attributes of a component. For example, a contact form component might have props for the name, email, and message fields.

State is the internal data of a component. For example, a contact form component might have state for the values of the name, email, and message fields.

To define a React component for your contact form, add the following lines of code to the file:

const ContactForm = (props, state) => {

return (

<form>

<label>Name:</label>

<input type="text" />

<label>Email:</label>

<input type="email" />

<label>Message:</label>

<textarea></textarea>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>

);

};

This code defines a React component called ContactForm. The component returns a HTML form element. The form element has input fields for the name, email, and message. There is also a submit button.

Now that you have a React component for your contact form, you need to render it. To do this, you'll use the ReactDom.render() function.

The ReactDom.render() function takes two arguments: a React component and a DOM element. The DOM element is where the React component will be rendered.

In this case, you'll want to render the ContactForm component in the <div> element with the id of "root". This <div> element is already defined in the file.

To render the ContactForm component, add the following line of code to the file:

ReactDom.render(<ContactForm />, document.getElementById('root'));

This code will render the ContactForm component in the <div> element with the id of "root".

Now that you've defined and rendered your contact form component, you need to add some CSS to make it look nicer.

Next.js comes with a built-in CSS-in-JS library called styled-jsx. This library makes it easy to style React components.

To style the ContactForm component, you'll need to add a style tag to the component. The style tag should be placed inside the component's return statement.

Inside the style tag, you can add CSS rules. These CSS rules will only apply to the ContactForm component.

To style the ContactForm component, add the following lines of code to the file:

const ContactForm = (props, state) => {

return (

<form>

<label>Name:</label>

<input type="text" />

<label>Email:</label>

<input type="email" />

<label>Message:</label>

<textarea></textarea>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>

);

};

ReactDom.render(<ContactForm />, document.getElementById('root'));

Now that you've added some CSS to your contact form, it's time to add a responsive design.

Responsive design is the practice of creating a website that looks good on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

There are a few things you'll need to do to make your contact form responsive. First, you'll need to add a viewport meta tag to the <head> element of the file. This meta tag tells the browser how to scale the page.

Add the following line of code to the <head> element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

Next, you'll need to add some media queries to your CSS. Media queries are CSS rules that only apply when the browser meets certain conditions.

For example, you might want to use a different CSS rule for mobile devices than you do for desktop computers. To do this, you would add a media query that only applies to mobile devices.

In this case, you'll want to use a media query that only applies to devices with a width of 768px or less. This will make sure that your contact form looks good on mobile devices.

To add a media query, you'll need to add a @media rule to your CSS. The @media rule should be placed inside the style tag.

Inside the @media rule, you'll need to specify the condition that must be met for the CSS rules to apply. In this case, the condition is width <= 768px.

To add a media query, add the following lines of code to the file:

const ContactForm = (props, state) => {

return (

<form>

<label>Name:</label>

<input type="text" />

<label>Email:</label>

<input type="email" />

<label>Message:</label>

<textarea></textarea>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>

);

};

ReactDom.render(<ContactForm />, document.getElementById('root'));

@media (width <= 768px) {

form {

width: 100%;

}

label {

display: block;

}

input,

textarea {

width: 100%;

}

}

This media query will make sure that the contact form takes up the entire width of the screen on mobile devices.

Now that you've added a responsive design to your contact form, it's time to add some content.

To do this, you'll need to add a <h1> element to the file. This element should be placed inside the <form> element.

The <h1> element will contain the text "Contact Form".

To add a <h1> element, add the following lines of code to the file:

const ContactForm = (props, state) => {

return (

<form>

<h1>Contact Form</h1>

<label>Name:</label>

<input type="text" />

<label>Email:</label>

<input type="email" />

<label>Message:</label>

<textarea></textarea>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>

);

};

ReactDom.render(<ContactForm />, document.getElementById('root'));

@media (width <= 768px) {

form {

width: 100%;

}

label {

display: block;

}

input,

textarea {

width: 100%;

}

}

Now that you've added content to your contact form, it's time to add a submit handler.

A submit handler is a function that is called when the form is submitted. This function will take the form data and send it to the server.

In this case, you'll want to use the fetch API to send the form data to the server. The fetch API is a built-in JavaScript API that makes it easy to make network requests.

To use the fetch API, you'll need to add a submit handler to the <form> element. This submit handler will be called when the form is submitted.

To add a submit handler, add the following lines of code to the file:

const ContactForm = (props, state) => {

const handleSubmit = (event) => {

event.preventDefault();

const formData = new FormData(event.target);

fetch('/contact', {

method: 'POST',

body: formData

});

};

return (

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

<h1>Contact Form</h1>

<label>Name:</label>

<input type="text" />

<label>Email:</label>

<input type="email" />

<label>Message:</label>

<textarea></textarea>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>

);

};

ReactDom.render(<ContactForm />, document.getElementById('root'));

@media (width <= 768px) {

form {

width: 100%;

}

label {

display: block;

}

input,

textarea {

width: 100%;

}

}

This code adds a submit handler to the <form> element. The submit handler prevents the default action of the form (which
