AI may help to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities

1. Introduction
    1. Attention-grabbing opening
    2. Thesis statement: Although AI may have some benefits, the implications are largely negative because it threatens to replace human creativity and could lead to a loss of jobs in the arts.
    3. Background information on AI generated art
    4. Overview of main points

2. Body Paragraph 1
    1. Point: AI generated art lacks originality and creativity.
    2. Support 1: Most AI generated art is simply a regurgitation of pre-existing images or ideas.
    3. Support 2: Even when AI does create something new, it is often derivative and uninspired.
    4. Rebuttal: Some argue that AI generated art can be creative and original, but this is not yet supported by evidence.
    5. Conclusion: Overall, AI generated art lacks the originality and creativity that humans possess.

3. Body Paragraph 2
    1. Point: AI generated art threatens to replace human artists and lead to a loss of jobs in the arts.
    2. Support 1: As AI gets better at creating realistic and lifelike images, there will be less need for human artists. 
    3. Support 2: If people can't tell the difference between AI generated art and human-made art, they are less likely to buy works from actual humans. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some believe that AI generated art will never be able to fully replace human artists because machines lack empathy and emotionality. 
    5. Conclusion: While it is possible that AI might not completely replace human artists, it still poses a threat to their livelihoods as it continues to develop.

4. Body Paragraph 3
    1. Point: The implications of AI generated art extend beyond the loss of jobs for human artists.
    2. Support 1: AI generated art could lead to a homogenization of culture as machine-made art becomes more prevalent. 
    3. Support 2: If people can't tell the difference between AI generated art and human-made art, they may start to value art less overall. 
    4. Rebuttal: Some argue that AI generated art can actually help to diversify culture by giving underrepresented groups a platform to create and share their own art. 
    5. Conclusion: While there are some potential positives to AI generated art, the negatives outweigh them because of the ways it could potentially harm society and devalue human creativity.

5. Conclusion
    1. Restate thesis statement
    2. Summarize main points
    3. Call to action or final thoughts

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the art world has been a controversial topic ever since the first examples of AI generated art were created. Although there are some benefits to using AI in art, the implications are largely negative because it threatens to replace human creativity and could lead to a loss of jobs in the arts.

AI generated art often lacks originality and creativity. Most AI generated art is simply a regurgitation of pre-existing images or ideas. Even when AI does create something new, it is often derivative and uninspired. Some argue that AI generated art can be creative and original, but this is not yet supported by evidence. Overall, AI generated art lacks the originality and creativity that humans possess.

AI generated art also poses a threat to human artists because it has the potential to replace them and lead to a loss of jobs in the arts. As AI gets better at creating realistic and lifelike images, there will be less need for human artists. If people can't tell the difference between AI generated art and human-made art, they are less likely to buy works from actual humans. While it is possible that AI might not completely replace human artists, it still poses a threat to their livelihoods as it continues to develop.

The implications of AI generated art extend beyond the loss of jobs for human artists. AI generated art could lead to a homogenization of culture as machine-made art becomes more prevalent. If people can't tell the difference between AI generated art and human-made art, they may start to value art less overall. Some argue that AI generated art can actually help to diversify culture by giving underrepresented groups a platform to create and share their own art. However, the negatives outweigh the positives in this case because of the ways AI generated art could potentially harm society and devalue human creativity.

In conclusion, AI may have some benefits, but the implications are largely negative because it threatens to replace human creativity and could lead to a loss of jobs in the arts. Although AI generated art may sometimes be creative or original, it is not yet at a level where it can fully replace human artists. Additionally, AI generated art could lead to a homogenization of culture and a devaluation of art overall. The potential positives of AI generated art are not enough to outweigh the negatives.
